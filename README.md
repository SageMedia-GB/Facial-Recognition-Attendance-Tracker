# ISM-Original-Work
### Program Preface
 This project was made for the Independent Study 
 Mentorship Program. The Independent Study Mentorship 
 Program is a rigorous research-based program offered 
 at Frisco ISD schools for passionate high-achieving 
 individuals.

Throughout the course of the program, students 
carry-out a year-long research study where they 
analyze articles and interview local professionals. 
Through the culmination of the research attained, 
students create an original work, presented at 
research showcase, and a final product that will be 
showcased at final presentation night. Through the 
merits of this program, individuals are able to follow 
their passions while increasing their prominence in the 
professional world and growing as a person.

The ISM program is a program in which students carry-on skills that not only last for the year, but for life. ISM gives an early and in-depth introduction to the students' respective career fields and professional world. Coming out of this program, students are better equipped to handle the reality of the professional world while having become significantly more knowledgeable of their respective passions. The ISM program serves as the foundation for the success of individuals in the professional world.
### Project Preface 
 Facial Recognition Based Attendance Tracker: This 
 attendance system uses image datasets to create an
 average encoding of the person. This encoding is 
 then compared with frame encodings from the camera 
 stream. Down below is the documentation for each 
 part of this application
