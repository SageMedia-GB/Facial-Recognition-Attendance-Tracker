List Information
=======================
The list information folder has 3 different text files: ``Encoding Names, Face Names Known, Full Student Names``, These text files
are loaded into lists within the python files. These text files have also allowed for the feature of dynamic addition of faces to emerge

   * ``Encoding Names.txt``: The ``Encoding Names`` file holds the names of the numpy files found in the ``Encodings`` subdirectory. This text file also adds names of new encodings.
   * ``Face Names Known.txt``: The ``Face Names Known`` file allows us to attribute the faces in the database to encodings. This consists of only the first names.
   * ``Full Student Names.txt``: The ``Full Student Names`` allows us to store full names so that they can be outputted onto a excel spreadsheet, google sheet, or text file.
