Cascades
===============
This is the Cascades Directory! Within the Cascades Directory, you will notice another folder known as data.
There are files within here that are named such as ``haarcascade_eye.xml``. These files are known as Haar Cascades!
Haar Cascades are most notably used for facial detection through finding key features within the face. You will see arbitrary
values within the cascades such as ``-1.2550230026245117e+00`` which are computer generated values based on the features of the faces
They were previously used in original iterations of this facial recognition project, however, because of the
integration of face detection with the face_recognition library, these are no longer used. These files while not used
are kept as archives of previous works and to explain the facial recognition process.

Naming Conventions
------------------
Thera are several cascades within the Cascades folder. These cascades all detect different features of the face. For
example the ``haarcascade_eye.xml`` detects eyes in faces. The ``haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml`` detects the face. The
``haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml`` also detects the face however it is just another version of the original haar cascade that was created.
