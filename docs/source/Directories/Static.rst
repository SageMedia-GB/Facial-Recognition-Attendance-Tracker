Static
===============
The static folder was made because with the flask application framework, it is necessary to have a static directory
to hold cascading stylesheets files, images and javascript files. Within the ``static`` folder, you will see a ``css`` folder ``js``
folder and an ``img`` folder.

   * ``css``: Holds Cascading Stylesheets Files
   * ``js``: Holds JavaScript Files
   * ``img``: Holds Images
