About the ISM Program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This project was made for the Independent Study Mentorship Program. The Independent Study Mentorship Program is a rigorous research-based program offered at Frisco ISD schools for passionate high-achieving individuals.

Throughout the course of the program, students carry-out a year-long research study where they analyze articles and interview local professionals. Through the culmination of the research attained, students create an original work, presented at research showcase, and a final product that will be showcased at final presentation night. Through the merits of this program, individuals are able to follow their passions while increasing their prominence in the professional world and growing as a person.

The ISM program is a program in which students carry-on skills that not only last for the year, but for life. ISM gives an early and in-depth introduction to the students' respective career fields and professional world. Coming out of this program, students are better equipped to handle the reality of the professional world while having become significantly more knowledgeable of their respective passions. The ISM program serves as the foundation for the success of individuals in the professional world.
